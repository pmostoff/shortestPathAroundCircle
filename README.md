# shortestPathAroundCircle

This Swift Playground demonstrates a function I wrote in order to determine the shortest path between two points located on the circumference of a circle (a 360 degree path). The function can return the distance of the shortest path and execute code based on whether the shortest path is a clockwise or counter-clockwise motion. 

### Function Description
This function accepts two `Double` values that represent points on the circumference of a circle. These values should be between `0.0` and `360.0` (within a 360 degree arc of a circle). The function then determines the distance of two arcs: one travelling clockwise around the circle between the two points, the other travelling counter-clockwise. This allows you to then execute further code based on whether the shortest path between the points is a clockwise or counter-clockwise translation.

## Installation
Simply copy and the paste the `shortestPathAroundCircle` function into your project.

## Requirements
`shortestPathAroundCircle` was built and tested using:
- Swift 4
